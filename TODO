Split models into separate module (somehow using the Flask-SQLAlchemy instance)
Better authentication: strong password hashing, password resets
Account creation in user manager
Admin bitfield in users
Restrict access based on IPs
Better validation in models
Share configuration between webapp and fetcher
Fetcher should become a service
RSS feeds for completed downloads

Ideas
=====
Extension API for download completion (GChat/IRC/Twitter etc.)
Extension API for individual sites (e.g. YouTube downloads)
Configuration manager in web app
Remote access API (JSON renderers for some views and OAuth)
Download multiple files concurrently
